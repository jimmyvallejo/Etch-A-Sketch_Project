# Etch-A-Sketch_Project

--Second Vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation project.

--I built this project in order to practice my vanilla javascript skills
 but this time with a more advanced GUI.

--I learned how to weave together different elements in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make them interact with eachother for an interactive user experience.

-- Gained stronger understanding of how loops can automate tasks on a webpage as well as CSS and flexbox styling techniques.
